# Description

This is the 'Send to Eidogo' add-on for Firefox.

This add-on was originally written by Adrian Petrescu, but he dropped
support for the Firefox add-on and is exclusively working on [a Chrome
version](https://github.com/apetresc/SendToEidoGo).

This re-implementation for recent versions of Firefox was possible
only because of the awesome, easy-to-use
[Jetpack](http://jetpack.mozillalabs.com) SDK which makes writing
plugins for Firefox SO SO EASY. I was suffering with the XUL pages and
never making headway.

# Usage

Simply install this add-on and then right click on the link to an SGF
file and then choose "Send to Eidogo".
